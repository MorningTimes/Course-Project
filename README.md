Purpose & Users

The purpose of this dashboard is to enable the user to gain deeper insights into fatal police shootings in the United States through an interactive visualization. The users of this dashboard would be those who have an interest in identifying larger scale trends of police shootings, above and beyond what can be ascertained from seeing reports of individual events on the news. The dashboard enables the user to explore several different variables in relation to fatal police shootings.

Data

This dashboard is built using data from a GitHub database compiled by the Washington Post. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the source file contains records of all of the fatal shootings by police officers in the line of duty in the United States. Many dimensions of data are collected, including name, date, manner of death, age, gender, race, city, state, threat level, mental illness, and body camera. My visualizations will focus on gender, race, age, state, and date. The dataset is regularly updated and is constantly growing. I updated my file twice over the course of working on this project due to new records.

Questions answered

My dashboard seeks to answer each of the following questions: 
•	What is the distribution across races?
•	What is the distribution across gender?
•	What is the distribution across age groups?
•	Which states have the most shootings?
•	Is there seasonality to fatal shootings?
•	Is the number of fatal shootings per year increasing or decreasing?

In addition, I have set each dashboard component as drill-down filters, so that combinations of these questions can also be answered. For example, how does the distribution of fatal shootings across races change by age group? Which state had the most shootings in 2015 vs 2020?
